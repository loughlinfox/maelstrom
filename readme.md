Some solutions to the [Maelstrom](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom) challenges.

Came across them on the [fly.io](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) site and thought they looked interesting.

Using Elixir ...
- apparently Elixir/Erlang are good for distributed systems stuff
- something new to learn
- seems like a bit of fun

Really just using it as a scripting language and copy pasting each solution to the next one as I go.
I don't expect that it will read very nicely to an experienced Elixir dev.

Solutions can be found in the `solutions` directory.
Currently only covering echo, broadcast, and g-set workloads.
Will see what else time and interest allows.
